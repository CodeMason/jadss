#summary How we're getting closer to the functionality required (TODO's & DONE's)
#labels Featured,Phase-QA

== Goals Achieved == 

  * Math Sounds (Sin waves and so):
     * Play fixed sound
     * Loop fixed sound
  * File Sounds (wav, au and maybe others):
     * Play sound
     * Loop sound
  * Use volume control to simulate distance.
  * Use time shifting to simulate distance.
  * Play only concrete sounds chunks, specified by time.
  * Solve the 'chunk' issue.


== Next Goals ==

  * Estimate maximum/minimum delay due to every layer on this system (to see which ones we're able to get rid of).
  * Math sound created or chosen in ET (execution time)
  * Ameliorate quality/precision relation (make it less file-dependant).
    * Solve the 'drain' delay
 
== Other Main Goals ==

  * Going distributed
  * Virtual app
