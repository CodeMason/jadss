#summary How we're getting closer to the functionality required (TODO's & DONE's)
#labels Featured,Phase-QA

== Goals Achieved == 

  * Math Sounds (Sin waves and so):
     * Play fixed sound
     * Loop fixed sound
  * File Sounds (wav, au and maybe others):
     * Play sound _---> bug to resolve_
     * Loop sound _---> bug to resolve_


== Next Goals ==

  * Math sound created or chosen in ET (execution time)
  * Refine and modularize
  * Use volume control to simulate distance.
  * Play only concrete sounds chunks, specified by time


== Other Main Goals ==

  * Loop limited (by time and/or times).
  * ...

  * Going distributed
  * Virtual app
