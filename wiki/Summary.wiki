= Introduction =

The project will consist in three major applications:

# A *preliminary version totally virtual*, which will generate tone pulses. Then, this version will also be useful as a virtual implementation, since it will include (hopefully) a 3D world where the four PC's (or in this case, sound sources) will be placed to simulate the distance from the listener with NativeFMOD (or an equivalent library). 

# A second version, *distributed*, a *real-life implementation* of the first version, solving the problem of managing the delays on the communications between different PCs. Positioning will not be implemented yet. 

# The *final version* with *real positioning*. We will have to discuss the positioning method, depending on different factors. This version may not be finished at the end of the project, but it will be anyway scheduled.
